#Chairmaster Project - Modern Chair Product Page (HTML, CSS)
This README provides an overview of the Chairmaster project, a product page for a modern chair built with HTML and CSS.

Features:

Displays product information (title, price, description, details)
Allows color selection with visual swatches
Offers an "Add to Cart" button for purchase intent
Getting Started:

Download the Files:

Save the provided HTML code as index.html.
Create a CSS file named style.css to handle the visual styling.
Consider including additional image files for the chair in different colors (chair_color1.jpg, chair_color2.jpg, etc.) if you plan to implement color variations.
Open the Project:

Launch your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Open the index.html file in your editor.
Preview in Browser:

Open index.html in a web browser to see the basic product page layout.
HTML Structure:

The index.html file provides the foundation for the product page. Here's a breakdown of some key elements:

Product Information: Elements like <h2>, <h4>, and <p> tags display the chair's title, price, description, and details.
Color Selection: Radio buttons with corresponding labels (<input>, <label>) allow users to choose from different colors.
"Add to Cart" Button: An anchor tag (<a>) styled as a button provides a clear call to action.
Chair Images: Multiple div elements with the class imgWrap serve as placeholders for chair images in different colors.
Styling with CSS (style.css):

The style.css file will be responsible for the visual design of the product page. You'll use CSS selectors to target specific elements in the HTML and apply styles like:

Fonts: Set font families, sizes, and colors for headings, paragraphs, and buttons.
Colors: Define the background color of the page, text colors, and color options for the chair.
Layout: Arrange elements using properties like margin, padding, and display.
Responsiveness (Optional): Consider using media queries to optimize the layout for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
